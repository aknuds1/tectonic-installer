# Welcome to the Tectonic tutorials!

Thank you for your interest in CoreOS Tectonic. We hope you’re excited to learn how Tectonic works and how enterprise-ready Kubernetes can improve your organization’s application infrastructure.

To help you get up and running with Tectonic, we have designed these step-by-step tutorials for the following platforms:

Step-by-step tutorials are also available for the [Tectonic Sandbox][sandbox-tutorials], a Tectonic testing environment designed for demo and self-learning purposes.

Each guide walks through:

1. Platform prerequisites and preliminary setup
2. Downloading and installing Tectonic
3. Using Tectonic to deploy, scale, upgrade, and manage a simple app
